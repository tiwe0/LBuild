# Notes on the second iteration of the compiler (aka "the new compiler"/"backend")

## Design

This sits behind the original compiler, taking in the processed & optimized AST, producing
a list of IR instructions, then finally generating assembly from that.

Instructions all linked together with an intrusive doubly-linked list. Basic blocks are
implicit.

Instructions are standard-objects that all derive from `backend-instruction`.
Instructions that end a basic block derive from `terminator-instruction`. Basic blocks are
started by a `label` instruction.

The first instruction in a function must always be an `argument-setup-instruction`.

Data flow is represented using `virtual-register` objects (vreg).
Instructions can take any number of vregs as inputs, and produce any number of vregs
as outputs. When in SSA form a vreg is defined by exactly once by one instruction. After
SSA deconstruction a vreg may be defined by multiple instructions. Instructions can
also directly reference physical registers (preg), though the compiler is less able to
reason about data-flow in this case. pregs are not permitted to be live over basic block
boundaries until after register allocation.

Local lexical variables can be represented as bound variables, these are named using
the `lexical-variable` class and can be loaded & stored normally. They are never in SSA
form, and are explicitly bound & unbound. Lexical variables are not immediatly converted
to SSA form because this loses debug lifetime information, and some hairy control-flow
involving NLX regions make this difficult. Bound variables must only be local (not captured)
and lexical (not special).

Common Lisp's multiple values are handled specially, outside the vreg/preg system.
Instructions specify that they consume or produce multiple values. These values, along
with the count of values, exist in the target's multiple value registers. Multiple
values can only be live over a small set of instructions.

Register allocation allocates registers for each virtual register, assigning them a
physical register. It may also insert stack spill/fill instructions as required.

Scoping of NLX regions, saved multiple values, and bindings...

Scoping of `make-dx-<foo>` instructions...

### Box instructions

Box/unbox instructions convert between boxed and unboxed values. A boxed value is a value represented using the normal value representation (a tagged pointer). An unboxed value is an integer, floating point, or simd value that is untagged and represented directly as-is, and not examined by the GC.

    * Pure.

* `box-single-float-instruction` - Box a `single-float` value.
* `box-double-float-instruction` - Box a `double-float` value.
* `unbox-instruction` - Base class of all unbox instructions.
    * Inputs a boxed value.
    * Outputs an unboxed value.
    * Pure.

* `unbox-double-float-instruction` - Unbox a `double-float` value.

### Debug instructions

Pseudo-instructions that do nothing except annotate the function's debug information.

* `debug-instruction` - Base class of all debug instructions.
    * Multiple-value safe.
* `debug-bind-variable-instruction` - Indicates that a lexical variable has been bound with the given value.
    * Inputs the new value of the variable.
* `debug-unbind-variable-instruction` - Indicates that a lexical variable has been unbound and is no longer live.
* `debug-update-variable-instruction` - Indicates that a lexical variable's value is now in another register.
    * Inputs the new value of the variable.

## Future directions

Only a few instructions produce more than one value. `label`, `argument-setup-instruction`,
and `multiple-value-bind`. A higher-level pure-SSA IR might get away with wiggling things
around so that all instructions produce a single "value", and values are referred to by
pointing directly at their defining instruction. That'd allow virtual-register to be
completely eliminated at that IR level, being fully implicit.

`instruction-inputs`/`instruction-outputs` cons up fresh lists each call. A better
representation of operands and outputs would reduce allocation in the compiler.
